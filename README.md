## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

A great challenge because this was my first project, I learned that the real questions start when you try to apply your knowledge to a particular process.  

First I took the design of the card to a piece of paper and there I tried to structure it as simple as possible. I divided the content in three big categories: Header, Section and Footer.

The major challenge was to position the two balls that are placed behind the card, because of this I learned the difference between "position: relative and absolut".


### Continued development

I will be focusing on learning the fundamentals of html and css, so I will be able to gain a solid knowledge and then move on to other areas. My next goal is to create the same design with a simplified code.


### Useful resources
